# Topper
Topper is a software that allows you to choose one or more windows to stay on top of your screen. This way, you can keep an eye on important applications without having to minimize or switch between them.

# Features

Select one or more windows to bring to the forefront using a keyboard shortcut or a context menu.

# Installation
To install Topper, you need to have a compatible Windows operating system (Windows 7 or higher). You can download the python file from (https://github.com/Dramexas/Topper/blob/main/main.py) or clone the GitHub repository from (https://github.com/Dramexas/Topper).

# Usage
To use Topper, you first need to launch the software by running the python script.

To bring a window to the forefront, you can right-click on the window's title bar and choose the "Bring to Front" option. You will then see a visual indicator on the window to show that it is in the foreground mode.

To disable the foreground mode for a window, you can right-click the window and disable. The visual indicator will disappear, and the window will resume its normal behavior.
